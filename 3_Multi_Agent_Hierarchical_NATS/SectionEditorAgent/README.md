# ‚úçÔ∏è Section Editor Agent

The **Section Editor Agent** (`section_editor_service.py`) is a crucial intermediate step in the content generation pipeline. Implemented as a **NATS-backed Python service**, it receives proposed topics from the Chief Editor, breaks them down into article sections, and delegates the writing task to the next service.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **NATS Communication:** Uses **NATS** for reliable, asynchronous messaging.
* **TLS Support:** Secure connections to the NATS server with **optional custom CA** configuration for enhanced security.
* **A2A Envelope Handling:** Processes standard **Application-to-Application (A2A) envelopes** received from the upstream Chief Editor service.
* **Context Propagation:** Ensures **trace/context propagation** is maintained across service boundaries for unified observability.
* **Structured Logging:** Implements **structured logging** throughout its lifecycle for easy monitoring and debugging.
* **Graceful Shutdown:** Supports a **graceful shutdown** upon receiving `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signals.
* **Section Generation:** Delegates the core task of generating structured article sections to the dedicated `SectionEditorAgent`.

## üèóÔ∏è Functionality & Workflow

The service acts as a handler for topics, performing the following core operations:

1.  **Listens** on its input NATS subject for A2A envelopes originating from the Chief Editor.
2.  **Extracts** the specific **topic** and any associated **options** from the incoming envelope's payload.
3.  **Delegates** the task to the `SectionEditorAgent`, which breaks the main topic into a structured outline or list of article sections.
4.  **Publishes** new child A2A envelopes, containing instructions for writing individual sections, to the downstream Writer subject.

## üì° NATS Subjects

| Type | Subject | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | `demo.section.in` | Subject the service **listens** on for incoming topics/requests from the Chief Editor. |
| **Output** | `demo.write.in` | Subject the service **publishes** completed section outlines to, for the downstream Writer service. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Environment Variables)

The service is configured primarily via environment variables for NATS connection settings:

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NATS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | The hostname or IP address of the NATS server. |
| `NATS_PORT` | `4222` | The port for the NATS server connection. |
| `NATS_USER` | `""` | Username for NATS authentication (if required). |
| `NATS_PASS` | `""` | Password for NATS authentication (if required). |
| `NATS_TLS` | `"true"` | Enables or disables TLS for the NATS connection. |
| `NATS_TLS_CAFILE` | `None` | Path to a custom CA certificate bundle (PEM format) for NATS TLS (optional). |
